Hello, I'm Hugo Grotius and this is my personal page. I'm a Dutch lawyer and
diplomat with experience from academia and government, having published a large
number of books on international law, sometimes even being called the "father"
of this field of study. I have experience working as a diplomat from serving as
the Swedish Ambassador to France. For a more comprehensive list of my experience,
see the [Resume]({{< ref "resume.md" >}}) tab.
